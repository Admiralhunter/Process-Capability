# Process-Capability

I was tasked to conduct a process capability for different parts that are ran through our machines. I utilize different R packages to analyze and create different plots and graphs aswell as excel spreadsheets to give to management. This was used to determine whether any changes in the process had occur as well as to show customers that we are capable of controlling our process. I analyzed multiple metrics such as Cp, Cpk, Skewness, Kurtosis, and ppm of non-conforming product.
